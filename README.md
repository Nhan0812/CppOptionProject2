# C++ Option Portfolio Variance Calculator

This software serves to compute payout variance of a portfolio of options (before and after each purchase)

This program can be used to check whether the next purchase will fit within a variance constraint
The class can track the sequence of purchases, allowing for a reset to a blank portfolio when necessary.
